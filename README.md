# SwiftUIVideoPlayer
Embarrassingly Simple SwiftUI Video Player

When I say "embarrassingly simple" I mean it. The entire SwiftUI program is 21 lines long, including the comment block and the blank lines. SwiftUI makes it extremely simply to play a video using a VideoPlayer SwiftUI View.

Feel free to use as you see fit.
